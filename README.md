# RabbitMQ Access Control Cache Plugin

## This was migrated to https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server

This repository has been moved to the main unified RabbitMQ "monorepo", including all open issues. You can find the source under [/deps/rabbitmq_auth_backend_cache](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/tree/master/deps/rabbitmq_auth_backend_cache).
All issues have been transferred.

## Project Maturity

As of 3.7.0, this plugin is distributed with RabbitMQ.

## Overview

This plugin provides a caching layer for [access control operations](https://rabbitmq.com/access-control.html)
performed by RabbitMQ nodes.

This plugin provides a way to cache [authentication and authorization backend](https://rabbitmq.com/access-control.html)
results for a configurable amount of time.

It's not an independent auth backend but a caching layer for existing backends
such as the built-in, [LDAP](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-auth-backend-ldap), or [HTTP](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-auth-backend-http)
ones.

Cache expiration is currently time-based. It is not very useful with the built-in
(internal) [authn/authz backends](https://rabbitmq.com/access-control.html) but can be very useful for LDAP, HTTP or other backends that
use network requests.

## RabbitMQ Version Requirements

As of 3.7.0, this plugin is distributed with RabbitMQ. Like any other plugin, it must
be [enabled](https://www.rabbitmq.com/plugins.html#ways-to-enable-plugins) before it can be used.


## Installation

This plugin ships with reasonably recent RabbitMQ versions
(e.g. `3.7.0` or later). Enable it with

``` shell
rabbitmq-plugins enable rabbitmq_auth_backend_cache
```

## Binary Builds

Binary builds can be obtained [from project releases](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-auth-backend-cache/releases/) on GitHub.

## Building

You can build and install it like any other plugin (see
[the plugin development guide](https://www.rabbitmq.com/plugin-development.html)).

## Authentication and Authorization Backend Configuration

To enable the plugin, set the value of the `auth_backends` configuration item
for the `rabbit` application to include `rabbit_auth_backend_cache`.
`auth_backends` is a list of authentication providers to try in order.


So a configuration fragment that enables this plugin *only* (this example is **intentionally incomplete**) would look like:

``` ini
auth_backends.1 = cache
```

In the [classic config format](https://www.rabbitmq.com/configure.html#config-file-formats):

``` erlang
[
  {rabbit, [
            {auth_backends, [rabbit_auth_backend_cache]}
            ]
  }
].
```

This plugin wraps another auth backend (an "upstream" one) to reduce load on it.

To configure upstream auth backend, use the `auth_cache.cached_backend` configuration key
(`rabbitmq_auth_backend_cache.cached_backend` in the classic config format).

The following configuration uses the [LDAP backend]((https://rabbitmq.com/ldap.html)) for both authentication and authorization
and wraps it with caching:

    auth_backends.1 = cache

    auth_cache.cached_backend = ldap

In the classic config format:

``` erlang
[
  {rabbit, [
    %% ...
  ]},
  {rabbitmq_auth_backend_cache, [
                                  {cached_backend, rabbit_auth_backend_ldap}
                                ]},
  {rabbit_auth_backend_ldap, [
    %% ...
  ]},
].
```

The following example combines this backend with the [HTTP backend](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-auth-backend-http/tree/master) and its [example Spring Boot application](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-auth-backend-http/tree/master/examples):


    auth_backends.1 = cache
    auth_cache.cached_backend = http

    auth_http.http_method   = post
    auth_http.user_path     = http://localhost:8080/auth/user
    auth_http.vhost_path    = http://localhost:8080/auth/vhost
    auth_http.resource_path = http://localhost:8080/auth/resource
    auth_http.topic_path    = http://localhost:8080/auth/topic

In the classic config format:

``` erlang
[
 {rabbit, [
           {auth_backends, [rabbit_auth_backend_cache]}
          ]
 },
 {rabbitmq_auth_backend_cache, [
                                {cached_backend, rabbit_auth_backend_http}
                               ]
  },
  {rabbitmq_auth_backend_http, [{http_method,   post},
                                {user_path,            "http://127.0.0.1:8080/auth/user"},
                                {vhost_path,           "http://127.0.0.1:8080/auth/vhost"},
                                {resource_path,        "http://127.0.0.1:8080/auth/resource"},
                                {auth_http.topic_path, "http://127.0.0.1:8080/auth/topic"}
                               ]
  }
].
```

It is still possible to [use different backends for authorization and authentication](https://www.rabbitmq.com/access-control.html).

The following example configures plugin to use LDAP backend for authentication
but internal backend for authorisation:

    auth_backends.1 = cache

    auth_cache.cached_backend.authn = ldap
    auth_cache.cached_backend.authz = internal

In the classic config format:

``` erlang
[
  {rabbit, [
    %% ...
  ]},
  {rabbitmq_auth_backend_cache, [{cached_backend, {rabbit_auth_backend_ldap,
                                                   rabbit_auth_backend_internal}}]}].
```



## Cache Configuration

You can configure TTL for cache items, by using `cache_ttl` configuration item, specified in **milliseconds**

    auth_cache.cached_backend = ldap
    auth_cache.cache_ttl = 5000

Or using the classic config for both parameters:

``` erlang
[
 {rabbit, [
   %% ...
 ]},
 {rabbitmq_auth_backend_cache, [{cached_backend, rabbit_auth_backend_ldap},
                                {cache_ttl, 5000}]}].
```

You can also use a custom cache module to store cached requests. This module
should be an erlang module implementing `rabbit_auth_cache` behaviour and (optionally)
define `start_link` function to start cache process.

This repository provides several implementations:

 * `rabbit_auth_cache_dict` stores cache entries in the internal process dictionary. **This module is for demonstration only and should not be used in production**.
 * `rabbit_auth_cache_ets` stores cache entries in an [ETS](https://learnyousomeerlang.com/ets) table and uses timers for cache invalidation. **This is the default implementation**.
 * `rabbit_auth_cache_ets_segmented` stores cache entries in multiple ETS tables and does not delete individual cache items but rather
   uses a separate process for garbage collection.
 * `rabbit_auth_cache_ets_segmented_stateless` same as previous, but with minimal use of `gen_server` state, using ets tables to store information about segments.

To specify module for caching you should use `cache_module` configuration item and
specify start args with `cache_module_args`.
Start args should be list of arguments passed to module `start_link` function

Cache module can be set via sysctl config format:

    auth_cache.cache_module = rabbit_auth_backend_ets_segmented

Additional cache module arguments can only be defined via the [advanced config](https://www.rabbitmq.com/configure.html#advanced-config-file) or classic config format:

``` erlang
[
 {rabbit, [
   %% ...
 ]},

 {rabbitmq_auth_backend_cache, [{cache_module_args, [10000]}]}
].
```

The above two snippets combined in the classic config format:

``` erlang
[
 {rabbit, [
   %% ...
 ]},

 {rabbitmq_auth_backend_cache, [{cache_module, rabbit_auth_backend_ets_segmented},
                                {cache_module_args, [10000]}]}
].
```

The default values are `rabbit_auth_cache_ets` and `[]`, respectively.
